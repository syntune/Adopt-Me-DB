A LuaU script used for the game Adopt Me on Roblox. It allows to fetch the datas of the game's various items and cosmetics and format them into a .json file.

Note that the result files will look quite messy (Adopt Me's database is significant), it's recommended to use a JSON beautifier. Example: https://jsonformatter.org/
