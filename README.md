A LuaU script used for the game Adopt Me on Roblox. It allows to fetch the datas of the game's various items and cosmetics and format them into a .json file. This repository already contains the .json obtained after executing the script, but you can still use it yourself in the situation Adopt Me updates new items.

Note that the result files will look quite messy (Adopt Me's database is significant), it's recommended to use a JSON beautifier. Example: https://jsonformatter.org/
